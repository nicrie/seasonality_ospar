# Code Repository
Welcome to the code repository for our paper currently under revision.

## Overview
In the spirit of transparency, open science, and reproducibility, we have made all scripts available for processing and analyzing the data, as well as for producing the figures used in our study. 

## Python Environment
The analysis for this work was entirely performed unsing Python 3.10. Ensure you have the necessary software and dependencies installed. Refer to the `environment.yml` file for a list of required packages. To install the required dependencies, you can use either `conda` or `mamba`:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ospar_seasonality
```

## Caveats
Due to size limitations on GitHub, some of the original data files (specifically data related to potential litter sources such as river discharge, fishing intensity, and exports) need to be downloaded from their respective data sources by the researcher. These data files are not provided directly in this repository. However, download scripts for some of these variables are included.
